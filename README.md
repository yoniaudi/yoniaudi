## 👋 Hi, I’m Yoni Audi
### 💻 Cross-Engine Developer  
C++ / C# / Python / Objective-C | Custom Engines / Unity / Cocos2d-x

---

### 🚀 About Me
I’m a cross-engine developer focused on building adapters,<br>
tools and integration layers that allow complex SDKs to work seamlessly
<br>across multiple game engines.

At Anzu.io, I work at the intersection of C++, Unity, Cocos2d-x<br>
and platform-specific build systems. My responsibility is ensuring the SDK runs<br>smoothly inside real game engines through robust adapters and engineering infrastructure.

### 💡 What I Actually Do
- Develop C++ and C# engine-specific adapters that connect the company’s SDK<br>
to Unity, Cocos2d-x and other runtimes.
- Develop graphics systems for Android, macOS, iOS and Windows.
- Build and maintain a Python-based multi-platform build & deployment pipeline automating<br>
compilation, signing, packaging and store uploads (Android, iOS and Windows).
- Collaborate with QA and product to maintain reliable cross-platform behaviour.

-> I’m passionate about clean architecture and cross-platform consistency.<br>
-> My work sits at the point where game engines meet native code.<br>
-> I enjoy solving the engineering challenges that sit behind the scenes of great games.
